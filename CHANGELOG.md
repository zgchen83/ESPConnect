# Changelog

## 1.1.7

## 1.1.6
### Improvement
- Serial Monitor now lets you send text input, including Ctrl+C, suggest by ator1811 ([issue #90](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/ESPConnect/issues/90)).

### Fixed
- Flash tools now refresh the partition table after full erase or firmware flashes so the partitions view stays accurate ([issue #104](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/ESPConnect/issues/104)).
- Partitions empty state now distinguishes between disconnected devices and connected ESP32s with no partition table ([issue #104](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/ESPConnect/issues/104)).
